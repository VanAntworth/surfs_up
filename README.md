## Overview of the analysis:  

### Determining if the surf and ice cream shop that W.Avy wants to open is sustainable year-round. Have been asked that we analyze two months in particular: June and July in Oahu.

## Results: 
### Three major points from the two analysis deliverables.(Images too)
The average temperature in June is about 75 degrees - perfect for suring and ice cream
The average temperature in December is about 71 degrees - not unfavorable for surfing or ice cream.

Both months have a standard deviation between 3-4 degrees. Making the the data *for* starting a surf shop more reliable as the temperatures will be staying very close to the average temperatures given - that we are using to base are notion of sustainablitly

Key differences in weather between June and December
 
 
## Summary: 

Based on the climate analysis performed for W.Avy the weather should be favorable for the ice cream and surf shop to be sustainable year around as we have been asked to perform analysis on two months that are half a year apart.

Further analysis into the sustainabilty of the shop would entail taking precipitation into accout for each month 
to do that we would create similar queries to pull precipitation data for the chosen months.
